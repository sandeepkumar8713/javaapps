We want to build a system that allows users to tag content from different products, and then to view content by tags. A goal of this system is that it should be built in a product-agnostic way, so that we could add new products in the future without a large amount of work.

There are three key experiences that we want to build here:

As a user I can add, remove, and update tags on content

As a user, I can click on a tag and see all content that has been associated with that tag

As a user, I can see a dashboard of popular tags

Imagine that you are on a team that needs to design and build the system to power this experience.
