// The chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve loose-coupling in software design where a request 
// from the client is passed to a chain of objects to process them. Then the object in the chain will decide 
// who will be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to the next object in the chain or not.

// We know that we can have multiple catch blocks in a try-catch block code. Here every catch block is kind of 
// a processor to process that particular exception. So when an exception occurs in the try block, itâ€™s sent to 
// the first catch block to process. If the catch block is not able to process it, it forwards the request to 
// the next Object in the chain (i.e., the next catch block). If even the last catch block is not able to process it, 
// the exception is thrown outside of the chain to the calling program.
