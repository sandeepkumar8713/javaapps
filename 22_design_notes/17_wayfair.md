## Design

**Theory**
1. Explain the difference between eventual consistency & strong consistency. Strong vs eventual consistency, differences and uses?
2. System design questions. 
   Topics included load balancing, Scaling, Datasharding, Single point Failure, consistency levels, Denormalization, atomic counters...
3. Load balancer pros/cons

**Pratical**
1. Design a large distributed system that provides some arbitrary service focusing on bottlenecks, tradeoffs, CAP, etc
2. Something like: design an application to manage a shop that rents out stuff to customers
3. Bicycle Shop OOD.
4. TinyURL.
    With focus on scaling, key generation, partitioning etc.
    Want you to explain your choices.
5. Design an automated parking lot having automated lift for parking a vehicle. Main focus was on class diagram and schema design.
   Automated parking garage
6. High Level Design of an app similar to Shazam
7. Design Automated Parking Garage
    Class Design
    Schema Design
    API Design
    High level diagram and data flows
    DB choice & queries
    Observability related questions
8. Design a bike rental system [API Design | Class Design | Schema Design]
    Focus on data object interations, sequence diagram,
9. Design a Url Shortener like TinyURL and track the usage for each individual URL.
10. System design: design check-in app, user can check in the location whatever he visits.:
    design four square or check-in based system.
11. Design an app like Instagram
12. Design the database schema for an app like Netflix
13. Design a rail and road network
14. Design a database like IMDB
15. Design Roulette(Object Oriented Desgin) and implement how much a user could win based on previous results. For eg if after 4 
    reds there will always be a black. How to use this information to determine how much will a user win.
16. Sports league database design. players are employees, belong to multiple teams, team belongs to league, games are played between   
    teams. Query for all teams and leagues that a player given first and last name belongs to.
    Query all players on al teams that play at a particular position
    query all players that are not on a team.
