# Do's and Don't in design interview

Youtube Like : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtmBGH8MkX4

1. Do not go in detail, early in the interview.
2. We should give opportunity to interview to give feedback.
3. Avoid fitting requirements to a set architecture in mind
4. Have **justifications** for the points you make. Don't use buzz words or half hearted thoughts in your design.
5. Be aware of the current solutions and tech practices. A lot of solutions can be purchased off the shelf which simplify \
   implementation. You should be able to argue for a custom implementation with it's pros and cons.
6. Express your thoughts in a clear manner.
7. When faced with a problem, use standard approaches to mitigate it. For example, say you are faced with an availability \
  problem. State that replication and partitioning help increase availability in general, and move on to offer a solution.
8. Don’t make points without thinking them through.
9. Know when to pick a solution vs. building something custom. If you name a product, you should be (generally) aware \
   of the features it provides. 
10. Design practices enable you to meet custom requirements. Examples are decoupling systems, load balancing, sticky sessions, etc…
11. Never have a set architecture in mind. We all try to fit requirements to a system, but only after it has been shaped by \
    the initial ones. A rigid attitude creates a brittle architecture. It will break before you do.
12. Keep it simple stupid.
13. Take a step back at times to make adjustments to the general architecture. Being focused on one part can narrow our vision \
    and bloat those areas. There will be components which can be extracted out and extended to the rest of the system.
14. **Clarity of thought**
15. **Flexibility**
16. **Knowledge**
