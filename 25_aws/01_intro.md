The performance data that you can use in the Amazon Redshift console falls into two categories:

**Amazon CloudWatch metrics** – Amazon CloudWatch metrics help you monitor physical aspects of your cluster, such as CPU 
utilization, latency, and throughput. Metric data is displayed directly in the Amazon Redshift console. You can also view it 
in the CloudWatch console. Alternatively, you can consume it in any other way you work with metrics, such as with the AWS 
CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.

**Query/Load performance data** – Performance data helps you monitor database activity and performance. This data is 
aggregated in the Amazon Redshift console to help you easily correlate what you see in CloudWatch metrics with specific 
database query and load events. You can also create your own custom performance queries and run them directly on the 
database. Query and load performance data is displayed only in the Amazon Redshift console. It is not published as 
CloudWatch metrics.
