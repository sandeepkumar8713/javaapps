# Freshworks 

1. Requirement gathering was good
2. No major scalable infra experience/deployment. 
3. Multi channel support(question)
4. High level design good.
5. Not specific in implmenation.
6. Storage, DB storage diffcult
7. Suggested ML modeling which was not required.
8. API composition and ack not good
9. Can't give alternative
10. SQL was average
11. Going back and forth

## My reflection
1. Discuss non-functional requirements.
2. Do normalization of DB tables.
3. Clear the understing before itself (confusion b/w msg retension and retry)
4. Pratice SQL
5. Proper API for authentication. (pass proper values in header)
6. Message format should be different for diferent channels like email and SMS.
