**Distinctive points**
limited number of readers and writers, Operation Queues
**Commutativity**: The order of applied operations shouldnâ€™t affect the end result.
**Idempotency**: Similar operations that have been repeated should apply only once.
1. **Operational transformation**
**Causality preservation**: If operation a happened before operation b, then operation a is executed before operation b.
**Convergence**: All document replicas at different clients will eventually be identical.

2. A **The Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)** satisfies both commutativity and idempotency by assigning two key properties to each 
character:
1. It assigns a globally unique identity to each character.
2. It globally orders each character.
